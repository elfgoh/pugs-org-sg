On behalf of all the PyCon organizing committee members, I would like to thank
you for taking time off to attend PyCon Singapore 2014 which was held at
[Singapore Polytechnic](http://www.sp.edu.sg/) from 18th June to 20th June. 

We organized this conference for the Python developer and student community in
Singapore and we are very grateful for your support.

You feedback regarding the conference will be critical in order for the
organizing committee to make PyCon SG 2015 even better than this year's
conference. A short [feedback form](
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1A5NoxhvrD2mnrT47b88LKjng63v3kZfT6smDOSc5rAk/viewform)
is available online which shall not take more than five minutes to
complete.

We have requested all speakers of the conference to send us links or PDF copies
of their slide decks. For those of you who are eager to view them, do look out
for updates on [this blog post](https://pycon.sg/news/2014/6/21/slides/)
which will be updated as as we receive the slide decks from the speakers.

This conference would not have been possible without the tremendous support we
have received. I would like to thank our sponsors, [Singapore
Polytechnic](http://www.sp.edu.sg), [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/),
[Odd-e](http://www.odd-e.com/), [Zopim](https://www.zopim.com/),
[Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/) and [Continuum
Analytics](http://continuum.io/), as well as Mr Gi and student helpers from
[Dunman High School](http://www.dhs.sg/) who played a huge role in ensuring that
the conference ran smoothly. Special thanks go out to our keynote speakers David
Cramer and Kenneth Reitz for flying down all the way from US to inspire us with
their keynotes.

Finally, as the chair of this conference, I would like to thank the organizing
committee for all their hard work in the past year to make this conference a
reality. In the coming weeks, we will be holding a meeting to elect the
organizing committee for PyCon SG 2015. If you are interested in joining the
PyCon 2015 committee, you may let know on the feedback form above.


Sincerely,  
Victor Neo

Chairman, PyCon Singapore 2014
