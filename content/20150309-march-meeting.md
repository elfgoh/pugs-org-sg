## Talks

1. "Getting started with testing using Pytest and Mock" by Gabe Hollombe.

Pytest is a great alternative testing framework to unittest from the
standard library. It often lets you get the same tests written with
far fewer lines of code, and it has a cool dependency injection system
to help you share common test dependencies while keeping your tests
understandable. I'll tell you all about how to get basic unit testing
done, and I'll show you how to use Voidspace's Mock library to test
collaborations between your objects, too.

Gabe is a full-stack senior engineer at Neo Innovation, with a thirst
for knowledge and a passion for sharing what he's learned. He's had
the pleasure of speaking on four different continents about
JavaScript, Ruby, Vim, and HTML5 Game development.

3. "Five Python tips" by Martin Brochhaus

We are hoping to repeat this talk with different speakers at the end
of each meetup. Martin will make the start and give quick
introductions to five Python tools that will make your life easier:

* Virtualenv / pyenv
* Tox
* pip-tools
* the @property decorator
* Fabric

Martin is the founder of Bitmazk Pte. Ltd., a Singapore based web
development agency specialized on creating web apps with Python and
Django. He is also part of the organizing committee for PyCon
Singapore and an active member of Python User Group Singapore.

4. Alfred from PyCon APAC will talk about the upcoming [APAC conference in Taiwan][apac].

You could share about your technology stack, how you solved a problem,

5 Python tips is a small segment at the end of meetup where you can
share some things that make your Python life easier. A newly
